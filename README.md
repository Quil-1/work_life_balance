# work_life_balance
This app helps developers maintain a good work-life balance by auto-shutting down their work system and denying them access after work hours

# _NB: OFFICE CLOSING TIME is set to 5:00 pm UTC_

# Requirements
1. Python Interpreter. If you don't have it kindly download it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

# HOW TO USE THIS SOFTWARE
1. RUN THE `shutdown_service_starter.bat file`. This will add an automatic Windows service to your PC
2. RUN THE `shutdown_listener_starter.bat` file. This will start a listener that listens to the Windows service

# Coming Improvements
1. GUI (Graphical User Interface) for the user to set an office closing time
2. Conversion to a software installer i.e msi file for a better installation user experience


THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
